# Code a Collage, Spring 2021
A workshop on creating a collage using Python and neural nets.

Leverage an open source style transfer neural net to make unique images and then code a collage using Python and the Pillow library.  One way to work through this workshop is by opening the .ipynb file in Google Colab or your Jupyter Notebook.
